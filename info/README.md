## Description
*Everyone in the party has died! Nothing beside remains! Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away!*

Independence, Missouri was made for the itch.io [Mystic Western Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/mysticwestern) over the course of two weeks. It is based on the classic 1970s educational game [The Oregon Trail](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990) along with the classic Percy Bysshe Shelley poem [Ozymandias](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/46565).
